**Your California Privacy Rights**

California's "Shine the Light" law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

**Data Security**

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. These measures include ensuring that Lightning Labs does not see information such as encrypted pairing phrases and cached node aliases and encrypting all traffic to our Website while in transit through us.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, for example where you generate an Encrypted Pairing Phrase, this is stored locally on your machine and you are responsible for keeping this information confidential. You should be vigilant of phishing attacks directing you to sites attempting to steal your pairing phrase before you have connected yourself. Ideally, you should bookmark Lightning Labs’ pages in your browser and only navigate to it using the bookmarks bar. YOU ARE PRINCIPALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR SECURITY AND THE SECURITY OF AUTHENTICATION CREDENTIALS STORED ON YOUR MACHINE.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. Without prejudice to the generality of the Terms of Service and in particular the limitation of liability provisions contained therein, we are not responsible for and shall not under any circumstance be liable for losses or damages arising from circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website, including but not limited to any such losses arising from your failure to keep your credentials secure.

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page. If we make material changes to how we treat our users' personal information, we will notify you by updating this page. The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for periodically visiting our Website and this privacy policy to check for any changes, as they will be binding on you immediately when made.
